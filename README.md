# Udacity_Project_1

tudent must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.

### Motivation
Within this project we will further analyze the StackOverflow surveys between 2011-2019. By using different techniques of data wrangling and manipulation we will try wo answer the following business questions:

1. Can we find any trend over time related to the participants and their employment?
2. Which programming languages are most popular? Are there any significant changes over time?
3. Which kind of developers are highest paid among the participants in the 2019 survey?
4. What are the top features which have most impact on salary in the 2019 survey?

### File description
In the repository we have all survey files as .csv downloaded from the Stackoverflow site. In order to simplify data loading process files were renamed to have a consistent naming convention ('<year> Stack Overflow Survey Results.csv'). Beside the input files there is one Jupyter Notebook file with all code used for the analysis including comments.
